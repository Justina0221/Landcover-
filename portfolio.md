### Site Overview
The Cheyenne River watershed is located within the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota near the oldest community of the Cheyenne River, Cherry Creek. The region features a complex mosaic of land uses, including native prairie, agricultural fields, and riparian corridors along the Cheyenne River. The topography is characterized by rolling hills and incised valleys, with elevations typically ranging between 2,000 and 2,700 feet. The Cheyenne River is a major tributary of the Missouri River, playing a crucial role in regional hydrology and providing habitat for a diverse range of plant and animal species. The surrounding landscape reflects a transition from semi-arid grassland to more intensively managed agricultural areas.

The Cheyenne River watershed area is notable for its proximity to intact native grasslands and relatively undisturbed riverine systems, making it a valuable site for studying ecological patterns and land cover dynamics.

### Data Description
The reflectance data used in this project is derived from the HLSL30 v002 product, part of the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project. It provides 30-meter Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) measurements. The HLS project combines observations from Landsat 8 and 9, as well as Sentinel-2 satellites, to provide high-quality, cloud-masked, and atmospherically corrected reflectance products with an 8-day revisit period. This enables consistent monitoring of land surfaces.

Additionally, USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) layers were utilized to define the hydrological context for the Circle P Springs - Cheyenne River site, ensuring that spatial analyses were conducted within ecologically meaningful units.

### Discussion
The first plot (RGB Image) shows a true-color composite (Red, Green, Blue bands) of the Cheyenne River region. It highlights the diverse landscape of the watershed:
The darker green areas likely represent denser vegetation or riparian corridors along the river.
The lighter, more uniform patches correspond to agricultural fields.
The rugged topography of the surrounding hills is visible, indicating erosional features and variable land cover.

The second plot (Clustered Image) displays a land cover classification derived from unsupervised clustering based on spectral reflectance values.
Different colors represent distinct clusters, corresponding to various surface types such as bare soil, crops, grasslands, or forested riparian zones.
The river corridor and associated floodplain vegetation are distinctly separated from adjacent agricultural lands and upland areas.
The clustering reveals significant heterogeneity within the landscape, which is essential for understanding ecological patterns, water resource dynamics, and effective land management strategies.
Together, these visualizations provide a foundation for analyzing spatial variability in vegetation, land use, and potential habitat areas within the Cheyenne River watershed.
